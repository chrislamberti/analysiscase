Business Project Details - Self Started

In 2012, I started a Twitter account tailored to the niche sport of lacrosse. I combined my passion for technology, social media and content creation to create a business that averaged 12 million impressions per month acrosse Twitter, Vine, and Instagram.

During my high school years, I enjoyed playing lacrosse but also watching some of the best in the game. Since lacrosse was (and still is) a niche sport, I spent a lot of time watching some of the greats of the game who competed at the highest level - NCAA Division 1.

I have always enjoyed videography, editing using software, and music development. I started creating short film content through the social media platform Vine - making edits of highlights from various high school, college and professional games that were attention grabbing and 'flashy.'

Soon enough, the channels grew organically to a 10k, 30k, 50k, 80k, and eventually over 100k audience solely on Twitter.



I started to monetize viewership on the platforms and worked with companies such as Warrior, The Lacrosse Network, EastCoastDyes, Gladiator and many small businesses to use reach and analytics to drive sales, target specific audiences, and increase brand awareness. 

I created tailored marketing campaigns for each of the sponsors I worked with, outlining a business plan with executable dates, KPIs and targets including CTR (Click-through ratio), CPM (Cost per mille), and CPC (cost per click).

In 2017, I sold the company to Whistle Sports, LLC as a part of their media expansion campaign effort.

Attached are images of some of the most successful Tweets included in the various sponsorship campaigns I ran.
